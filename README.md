# Cancer Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of breast cancer into benign and malignant categories based on patient data. Leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks and logistic regression, the system analyzes 16 distinct parameters to make predictions, aiding in determining appropriate treatment plans for patients.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis:** Explore and understand the provided dataset, consisting of 16 parameters gathered from patients, including mean nuclear radius, smoothness, and texture.

- **Modeling Techniques:** Implement two classification methods - neural network and logistic regression - to predict whether a given case is benign or malignant.

- **Medical Decision Support:** Enable healthcare professionals to make informed decisions about patient treatment by providing accurate and timely classifications.

## Data

The dataset comprises 16 different parameters, sourced directly from `sklearn.datasets`. The parameters include mean nuclear radius, smoothness, texture, among others, each contributing to the comprehensive analysis conducted by the classification models.
